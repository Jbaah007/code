# Motivational Quotes Scraper and NLP Analyzer

## Project Description

This project is a comprehensive web scraping and natural language processing (NLP) application developed for academic analysis. The goal is to collect motivational quotes from a publicly accessible website, clean the collected data, and perform NLP techniques to uncover patterns and insights.

It consists of two major parts:
1. **Web Scraping (crawler.py):** Scrapes quotes, authors, and tags from [http://quotes.toscrape.com](http://quotes.toscrape.com) and stores them in a CSV file (`sample_data.csv`).
2. **NLP Analysis (NLP_analysis_script.py):** Cleans the scraped quotes and analyzes them using multiple hypotheses, including frequent word counts, bigram/trigram analysis, author sentiment, and vocabulary richness.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone or download the project folder.
Ensure all files below are in one folder:
- `crawler.py`
- `NLP_analysis_script.py`
- `sample_data.csv` (generated by the crawler)
- `cleaned_quotes.csv` (generated during NLP analysis)
- `README.md` (this file)
- `positive_words.csv` (list of positive words used in H1)
- `Deliverable3_Report.pdf` (IEEE format project summary)

### 2. Set up the environment

I recommend using **Anaconda** for managing the environment.

```
conda create -n quotes_env python=3.11
conda activate quotes_env
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, install dependencies manually (see below).

### 3. Run the scraper (optional)
If you want to re-scrape quotes from the website:

```
python crawler.py
```

This generates a fresh `sample_data.csv` file.

### 4. Run the NLP analysis

```
python NLP_analysis_script.py
```

This script will clean the quotes, analyze linguistic patterns, and print insights to the terminal.

## Dependencies

The following Python libraries are required:

```txt
pandas
requests
beautifulsoup4
lxml
```
Install them with:

```
pip install pandas requests beautifulsoup4 lxml
```

> Ensure `sample_data.csv` is available in the working directory before running the NLP script.
